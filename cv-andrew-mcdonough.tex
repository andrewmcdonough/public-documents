% Tell LaTex what kind of document you're writing, and the default font size

% == START HEADER ==

% The header in Latex contains formatting information, which is kept
% separate from the normal flow of the document c.f. CSS for your HTML

% You can also include functionality from external packages using
% the \usepackage command

% The hyperref package facilitates links within the document
\usepackage{hyperref}

% The geometry package gives you fine-grained control of the page layout
% Here I use it to set the margins
\usepackage[hmargin=2cm,vmargin=2cm]{geometry}

% LaTeX is fairly generous with spacing, which is good for long documents
% I want to try to fit my CV onto once page so I've changed the line
% spacing to be 0.7 of the default spacing
\linespread{0.7} 

% Again to fit onto one page, I've make the paragraph spacing smaller by 2mm 
\addtolength{\parskip}{-2mm}

% Set the link color and some information about the document
\hypersetup{
  colorlinks = true,
  urlcolor = blue,
  pdfauthor = {Andrew McDonough},
  pdftitle = {CV - Andrew McDonough},
  pdfkeywords = {},
  pdfsubject = {CV},
}

% Don't number pages
\pagestyle{empty}

% Don't indent paragraphs
\setlength{\parindent}{0mm}

% == END HEADER ==

% == BEGIN DOCUMENT ==
